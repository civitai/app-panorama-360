/**
 * 🔴 THE STORE READS ONE VERSION AND THE BUILD READS THE OTHER.
 *
 * `block.manifest.json` is what the platform reads: it decides the submitted
 * version, and `civitai app submit` refuses anything not above the highest
 * approved one. `package.json` is what the build and the toolchain read. A
 * release that bumps only one of them is a real, shippable defect, and nothing
 * else in this repo notices it.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. On 2026-08-27 a batch that added the manifest's
 * `repository` key bumped the manifest and left `package.json` behind in SEVEN
 * apps at once. Two of them — civitai-app-model-benchmarking and
 * civitai-app-playable-collections — already had this assertion and went red
 * immediately (`expected '0.3.2' to be '0.3.1'`). The other five, this repo
 * among them, took the same bad change silently and one of them MERGED and
 * shipped that way. This file is the port of the guard that worked.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a literal (`toBe('1.2.3')`). A literal pins nothing worth
 * knowing — "the version is the version" teaches a reader nothing — and it rots
 * on every single bump, turning the default branch red on a release that broke
 * nothing. A permanently-red gate is worse than no gate: it trains everyone to
 * merge through it, and the next real defect arrives looking exactly like this
 * one. The relationship between the two files cannot rot on a bump, and it
 * still fires when someone bumps only one.
 *
 * Read off disk rather than imported, on purpose: `tsconfig.json` here scopes
 * `include` to `src` and does not set `resolveJsonModule`, so `import pkg from
 * '../package.json'` would not typecheck. `import.meta.url` makes the paths
 * independent of the working directory the runner happens to use.
